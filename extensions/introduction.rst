Introduction
============

Extensions are functionalities that add something new to framework or to another extension.

They can be placed in the flowing directories:

* ``parent-theme/framework-customizations/extensions/``
* ``child-theme/framework-customizations/extensions/``

.. note::

   Every extension has everything it needs in its own folder: settings, options, scripts, styles, etc. In this way, extensions can be easy added or removed.
