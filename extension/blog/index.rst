Blog Posts
==========

This extension is used to change WordPress default post labels from **Posts** to **Blog Posts**,
and the categories taxonomy from **Categories** to **Blog Categories**. Considering the increased use of custom 
posts, we felt the name Posts doesn't explain exactly what the menu item means so we choose to change it from **Posts** to **Blog Posts**.

.. note::

    Users will be able to modify the titles from the framework ``.pot`` file.
