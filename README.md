# [Unyson](http://unyson.io/) [Documentation](http://manual.unyson.io/)

Unyson is a framework for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) that facilitates development of a theme.

This framework was created from the ground up by the team behind [ThemeFuse](http://themefuse.com/)
from the desire to empower developers to build outstanding WordPress themes fast and easy.
